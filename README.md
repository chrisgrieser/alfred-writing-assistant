## Usage
The workflow offers four [hotkeys](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/hotkey/):

1. Autocorrect the word under the cursor.
2. Suggest synonyms for the word under the cursor.
3. Rephrase the selected text via ChatGPT, improving its language (requires
   OpenAI API key).
4. Same as 3, but use Markdown markup to show the changes:
	+ Additions are displayed as `==highlights==`.
	+ Deletions are displayed as `~~strikethroughs~~`.
	+ There is a workflow configuration to alternatively format the changes as
	  [Critic Markup](https://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-6/syntax/critic.html).
