## Usage
The workflow offers three [hotkeys](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/hotkey/):

1. Autocorrect the word under the cursor.
2. Suggest synonyms for the word under the cursor.
3. Rephrase the selected text via ChatGPT, improving its language (requires
   OpenAI API key). There are 3 formatting options:
	+ Plain: just output the changed text.
	+ Markdown: Additions are displayed as `==highlights==`, deletions are
	  displayed as `~~strikethroughs~~`.
	+ [Critic Markup](https://github.com/CriticMarkup/CriticMarkup-toolkit).

## Credits
In my day job, I am a sociologist studying the social mechanisms underlying the
digital economy. For my PhD project, I investigate the governance of the app
economy and how software ecosystems manage the tension between innovation and
compatibility. If you are interested in this subject, feel free to get in touch.
