## Usage
The workflow offers four [hotkeys](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/hotkey/):

1. Autocorrect the word under the cursor.
2. Suggest synonyms for the word under the cursor.
3. Rephrase the selected text via ChatGPT, improving its language
	+ Requires OpenAI API key.
	+ There are 3 formatting options: Overwrite selection, changes as Markdown
	  ==highlights== and ~~strikethroughs~~, and [Critic
	  Markup](https://github.com/CriticMarkup/CriticMarkup-toolkit).
4. Apple Intelligence Writing Tools
	+ This is just a convenience hotkey to trigger the Writing Tools selection
	  via keyboard, it works the same as if you click the item in `Edit` →
	  `Writing Tools`.
	+ Note that Apple Intelligence availability depends on your country, your
	  macOS version, and the app.

## Credits
In my day job, I am a sociologist studying the social mechanisms underlying the
digital economy. For my PhD project, I investigate the governance of the app
economy and how software ecosystems manage the tension between innovation and
compatibility. If you are interested in this subject, feel free to get in touch.
