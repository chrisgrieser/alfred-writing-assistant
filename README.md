## Usage
The workflow offers three [hotkeys](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/hotkey/):

1. Autocorrect the word under the cursor.
2. Suggest synonyms for the word under the cursor.
3. Invoke `Apple Intelligence Writing Tools`.

You can also trigger the synonym suggestion with the keyword `syn`.

## Credits
In my day job, I am a sociologist studying the social mechanisms underlying the
digital economy. For my PhD project, I investigate the governance of the app
economy and how software ecosystems manage the tension between innovation and
compatibility. If you are interested in this subject, feel free to get in touch.
