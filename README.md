## Version 2.0: Removal of the ChatGPT Rephraser
Since Apple Intelligence has become more available, and is—at least for
proofreading tasks—as competent as ChatGPT, the Rephraser has become obsolete.

If you want to continue using the `Rephraser`, you can download [the last
version of the workflow that still supports
it](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/alfred-writing-assistant/releases/tag/1.8.1).

If you use Obsidian, you can also use the [Obsidian Proofreader
Plugin](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/obsidian-proofreader) which does proper
inline suggestions.

## Usage
The workflow offers three [hotkeys](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/hotkey/):

1. Autocorrect the word under the cursor.
2. Suggest synonyms for the word under the cursor.
3. Invoke `Apple Intelligence Writing Tools`.

## Credits
In my day job, I am a sociologist studying the social mechanisms underlying the
digital economy. For my PhD project, I investigate the governance of the app
economy and how software ecosystems manage the tension between innovation and
compatibility. If you are interested in this subject, feel free to get in touch.
